This is a very rough inverse kinematics system build for a robotics demonstration. The demo unit is a small 3d printed robotic arm on a rotating base.

The main program takes 3 values which indicates a target point. It then writes out the rotation value for the base and all of the servos on the arm.

This was ported from a closed source 3D inverse kinematics system written by [Martin Evans](martindevans.me) for [Placeholder Software](placeholder-software.co.uk).
